# Presenters and Decorators: A Code Tour
## Mike Moore

Mike (@blowmage) plays pingpong.

Use presenters only after you feel pain.

Arguing about the view is a popular time trap; "bike shed".

ActiveDecorator inspects the classes of variables passed to views and looks for
a module named #{class.name}Decorator and includes it. So it's transparent. Too
much magic?
